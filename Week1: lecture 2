- bulleting/numbering is straigt forward
- links use square brackets for the title and link within paranthesis 
- use three ``` for code blocks, followed by the name of the programming language to be used.  
  Theres also a coloring scheme for each language.
- to make a new line, add two spaces or two enters to have a new line ( its called new paragraph )
