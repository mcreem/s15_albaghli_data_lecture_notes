Examples of manipulating users through GET, UPDATE, DELETE.

- right after the question mark woulf indicate query
  GET /api/1.0/search?q=tattersail (this would search with tatersail as the query)
  
POST and PUT sends data

we can individually create posessionsions that are independant of users
users/0
posessions/1
but users/0/posession# creating posessions for user0

so we have to think about how we would want to create them, what the data is like 
and whats the true relationships like.


- GET /api/1.0/posts/0/comments/1  >> this would retrieve the post's first comment
however 
- GET /api/1.0/posts/0             >> this would return all comments of post 0
