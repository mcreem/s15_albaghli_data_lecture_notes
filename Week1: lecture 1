Social Networks: with social networking tools, lots of data generated.

data analytics:
  - sampling 
  - 

Storage
  - No SQL (e.g. casandra delivers data as fast as possible, but not good in fast query)
  - Graph (dtabases and analytics)
  - key value stores
  - colomer

Data modeling is hard to do, easy to get wrong.

Data lifecycle: [we collect data when we have a question]
  - whats the question (curation: longevity of the data source + triage) <----
  - collection (from web or sensors etc)                                      |
  - Clean up                                                                  |
  - Storage                                                                   |
  - Processong/analysis                                                       |
  - Query + Visualize + act ----------------- new questions ------------------
  
  note: curation is prioritization of the data source, which will give me the best value
  
  this cycle is in any startup/company in the data feild.
  
  The most common way that useres interact with big data through Http request:
